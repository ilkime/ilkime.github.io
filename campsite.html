					<h3>PERSONAL WATER FILTER</h3>
					<p>You hope you’ll never have to use the LifeStraw, but you’ll be glad you brought it along in case you ever need it. The compact personal water filter removes well over 99.99% of waterborne parasites, bacteria, and microplastics, making the undrinkable drinkable. Having one of these on your person while camping can mean the difference between life and death if you become stranded without sterile water.</p>

					<h3>MEDICAL KIT</h3>
					<p>Like the LifeStraw, a first aid kit is something you hope you’ll never have to use but will never regret bringing along. But not all first aid kits are created equal. This example from Adventure Medical is designed specifically for the challenges of outdoor ailments, with supplies to treat various types of animal attacks, field injuries, and more. The gear is divided up into injury-specific sections for ease of use in an emergency, and the included wilderness medicine guide provides instructions on how to treat more than 50 common outdoor afflictions.</p>

					<h3>SELF-INFLATING SLEEPING PAD</h3>
					<p>Once thought of as a luxury, the sleeping pad is being thought of as a camping essential more and more as time goes on. And it’s easy to see why, as sleeping on a soft and supportive surface makes for a much more restful night than just plopping a sleeping bag on the lumpy ground. This pad from REI offers excellent ground insulation for those chilly nights, while its self-inflating design makes setup a breeze.</p>

					<h3>FLASH STOVE</h3>
					<p>While cooking at camp can be a fun experience, it can turn stressful if it becomes too time-consuming. After all, you don’t want to spend your entire trip cooking — you’re on vacation! That’s where Jetboil’s Flash Stove comes in. In case you couldn’t tell by the name, this compact stove will heat up your grub in a hurry. It features a match and lighter-free lighting system to get you started immediately, and its quick boiling cooking will have your food ready in under two minutes.</p>

				<div>
						
					<h3>GOOD QUALITY HIKING SHOES</h3>
					<p>While you’ll pretty much want to live in camping slippers during your getaway, some excursions require footwear that’s a bit more hardwearing. For those situations, you’ll need a solid hiking shoe, and Danner makes some of the best in the world. The Trail 2650 Campo combines lightweight breathability with abrasion resistance and durability, offering you the best of both worlds. They’re also comfortable thanks to an ultra-lightweight EVA midsole, and the Vibram 460 outsole with Megagrib provides excellent traction on both dry and wet surfaces.
